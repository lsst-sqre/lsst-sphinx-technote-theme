Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I'll alert the crew. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.

About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. The unexpected is our normal routine. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone.

The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules.

Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once.

Computer, lights up! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. I am your worst nightmare! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.

Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Damage report! I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.

I'll alert the crew. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?

Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your head is not an artifact! Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Computer, belay that order.

Talk about going nowhere fast.

- When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?
- Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?

  - Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly!
  - The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere!
  - The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little.

- Damage report!

Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz.
